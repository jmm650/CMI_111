      <h2> <strong>About Me: </strong> </h2>
                <p>
          Throughout my career, I have been recognized for being an out-of-the-box, open minded thinker, creator, and educator. Observing my students throughout the years, I truly love providing them and allowing them to become fully immersed and excited in their learning environment. Finding new ways to offer my students hands on, genuine and exciting learning opportunities is rewarding when I observe their 'ah ha' moment as they achieve new endeavors.
          </P>
